This initial version of JCaseChanger simply takes whatever text is on the 
clipboard and toggles the case of each letter (lower case letters are converted 
to UPPER CASE and vice-versa). The result is placed back on the clipboard. 

When you run the program, it toggles the case on the clipboard (as described 
above), then exits. There is absolutely no user interface to the program.

For ease of use, it is suggested that you create a shortcut to the application 
somewhere readily accessible (for example on Windows XP, it could be the Quick 
Launch toolbar).

A typical use-case would be if you're typing something in a text editor and 
realise you've left caps-lock on by accident for the last three paragraphs.
Instead of retyping it all, simply copy the text to the clipboard (using 
standard functionality), run JCaseChanger and paste the (now correctly 
capitalised) text back into your editor.

To run JCaseChanger, you must have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.
